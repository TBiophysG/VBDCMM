- We develop Bayesian version of double chain markov model using variational inference technique.
- The method is used to analyze H-DNA dynamics which shows dynamic disorder due to their complex free energy landscape.
- The method can be applied to any one dimensional time traces.
- The result is published in PLoS Computational Biology journal.
